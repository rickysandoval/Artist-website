    <p>Welcome! My name is Ricky Sandoval, and I'm a portrait artist hailing from Crested Butte, Colorado. I specialize in charcoal
        on neutral colored papers.</p>
    <p>I inherited my love of drawing from my Dad, Rick Sandoval Sr., who has immense talent for drawing as well as airbrushing and woodwork.
        Living in the mountain town of Crested Butte, as a kid I was captured by the natural beauty around me and loved to draw the animals 
        and landscapes I saw. As I grew older my focus turned more to the people I watched and interacted with.</p>
    <p>Today I focus mostly on portraits. I love trying to capture someone and put a little bit of the human element down on paper.
    I work in all black and white other than the color of the paper for the challenge of bringing an image to life with contrast and 
    texture rather than color.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from Cornell University and am pursuing a career in front-end web development.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about my work, possibly commisioning a piece, or anything else, feel free to shoot me an 
    <a href="contact">email.</a> Thanks for stopping by!</p>
    <p>Ricky Sandoval</p>
