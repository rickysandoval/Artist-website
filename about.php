    <p>

    Welcome! My name is Ricky Sandoval, and I'm a portrait artist hailing from Colorado living in Ithaca, NY. 

    I specialize in charcoal on neutral colored papers.

    <br><br>

    I inherited my love of drawing from my Dad, Rick Sandoval Sr., who has immense talent for drawing as well as airbrushing and woodwork.

    Living in the mountain town of Crested Butte, as a kid I was captured by the natural beauty around me and loved to draw the animals 

    and landscapes I saw. As I grew older my focus turned more to the people I watched and interacted with.

    <br><br>

    Today I focus mostly on portraits. I love trying to capture someone and put a little bit of the human element down on paper. I work in all black 

    and white other than the color of the paper for the challenge of bringing an image to life with contrast and texture rather than color.

    <br><br>

    I recently graduated from Cornell University and am persuing a career in front end web development and design.

    <br><br>

    If you have any questions about my work, possibly commisioning a piece, or anything else, feel free to shoot me an email. Thanks for stopping by!

    <br><br><br>

	Ricky Sandoval
